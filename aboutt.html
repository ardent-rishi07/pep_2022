    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <p>

        Time and Date AS is based just outside Stavanger, Norway, where our teams work together to operate timeanddate.com, the world's top-ranking website for time and time zones. With free online services you can rely on, we make it easier to organize your life, both at work and at home.

        Our German and Norwegian sites, timeanddate.de and timeanddate.no, offer the same high level of accuracy and reliability as our English language site.
        
        You can also enjoy our content on your phone or tablet because we make apps for iOS and Android too!
        
        And if you are a developer, try our API service to tap into our extensive databases for time and time zones, calendars, holidays, and more.

<h2>OUR TEAM </h2>
<p>
    One of the most important that everyone should learn is teamwork. You can define collaboration as the coming together of people to complete a particular task or activity. All the members have different tasks to complete to achieve the goal.





    Teamwork is one of the bare minimum requirements for any organization to function and achieve all its goals. All organizations are divided into many sections or teams which work to accomplish the tasks.
    
    The absence of teamwork will hinder the working of any organization. When any organization functions without cooperation, it wonâ€™t be able to complete the tasks.
